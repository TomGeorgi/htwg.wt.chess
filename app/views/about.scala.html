                Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered
                board with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid.
                The game is played by millions of people worldwide.

                Play involves no hidden information. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights,
                two bishops, and eight pawns. Each piece type moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least
                powerful the pawn. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat
                of capture. To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, while supporting each other.
                During the game, play typically involves exchanging pieces for the opponent's similar pieces, and finding and engineering
                opportunities to trade advantageously or to get a better position. In addition to checkmate, a player wins the game if the
                opponent resigns, or (in a timed game) runs out of time. There are also several ways that a game can end in a draw.

                            Chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game chaturanga
                            sometime before the 7th century. Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games xiangqi (Chinese chess),
                            janggi (Korean chess), and shogi (Japanese chess). Chess reached Europe by the 9th century, due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.
                            The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century; the modern rules were standardized in the 19th century.

                        The player controlling the white pieces is named "White"; the player controlling the black pieces is named
                        "Black". White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required; it is not legal to skip
                        a move, even when having to move is detrimental. Play continues until a king is checkmated, a player resigns,
                        or a draw is declared, as explained below. In addition, if the game is being played under a time control
                        players who exceed their time limit lose the game.

                        The official chess rules do not include a procedure for determining who plays White.
                        Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules
                        (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or round-robin tournament) or, in the case of non-competitive play,
                        mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed.
                        A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand;
                        the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.
